Portfolio Optimisation (Finance)

Overview

Applied financial modelling to construct risk-adjusted investment portfolios using CAPM and numerical optimisation techniques.

Dataset
	•	Stock price data for 10 global technology companies vs. S&P 500.

Methodology
	•	Calculated expected returns, alpha, and beta with CAPM and OLS regression.
	•	Optimised portfolios using SLSQP to minimise variance for different target returns.
	•	Visualised efficient frontiers to guide investment strategy.

Technology Stack

Python · Pandas · NumPy · SciPy · Matplotlib

Results
	•	Produced efficient frontier curves for portfolio risk vs. return.
	•	Showed practical application of CAPM and regression in investment optimisation.
